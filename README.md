Instead of traversing high end property locations players will travel all around the world with passing go representing a complete circumnavigation. 

Jail: In this circumnavigation, you have landed in Antartica. Due to the south pole's tilt away from the sun no transportation is available. 

Currency: Instead of money players will gather "protectors", with more protectorsm they will be able to set up more camps. 

Camps: Camps are the equivalent of houses. camps will be set up in area Types. These Area Types are the following: {"Starting Area", "Madagascar", "Tax", "Zoo", "Micronesia", "Community Area", 
        "Chance Area", "Jail", "Borneo", "Utility", "Tropical Andes", "Sky Islands", "Medditerranean Basin", "Arctic", "Amazon"}

Camps are further compounded into sanctuaries. These sanctuaries require more protectors but subsequently their size lead to more visitations and ultimately more yield. 

Animals: Animals are the individual lots you can purchase. I have choose extinct animals from each region ('Mediterranean basin, Madagascar, Micronesia') 
such as the borneo Orangutan.
